# PERN Car Booking Reservation System

This project, developed as a term project for the database class,with my team, presents a comprehensive car booking and reservation system built using the PERN (React, Node.js, Express, Postgresql) technology stack. It caters to three distinct user roles:

- **Staff:** Assigned to specific buildings, staff members efficiently manage customer reservations, providing valuable support.
- **Admin:** As the system's central governing force, the admin oversees staff management and building configuration, maintaining overall system functionality.
